# Pi_ESP32_BLE
This project allows you to communicate between a Raspberry Pi and ESP32 using BLE. I will accompany this project with a Medium article soon.

* `ble_esp32.py`: This will run on your ESP32 to connect to the Pi.
* `esp32_correct`: This will run on your Pi to connect to the ESP32. No the file name is not wrong. I chose that file name because I was distinguishing it from the old versions of the file I was working on.
* `find_mac.py`: This will find the MAC address of your ESP32.
